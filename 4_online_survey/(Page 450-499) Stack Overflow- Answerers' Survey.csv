The CC license provides just fine. The examples either aren't copyrightable in the first place, or merely used as starting point (not used exactly as-is, not very different from reading an ""All rights reserved"" education book when learning programming, and ""using"" it in your career every day going forward). In addition, there is also the attitude of authors. Where I might care about attribution for distribution of my answer, the code within my answer is always Public Domain for me, meaning, I would never defend it.
